                        One of the ways of interaction between individuals and/or communities is through dissemination and support, for that we launched the Yellow Hearts NFT collection with 1000 unique hearts on the Fantom network, this being the first of other collections ðŸ’•, where the purchase of a Yellow Heart is a way of supporting the project and the community itself, allowing us a way to return this support to you, whether through giveaways or acquiring NFTs to support another project, being able to donate these back to the community, thus creating a network of interaction between the entire web3's ecosystem. In addition to supporting the web3 community, we also want to pass on the meaning of a Heart to other people (love, union, care, life), so we will donate 25% of the sales proceeds to an NGO (for each collection a different ngo).
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-black pb-4">
                        Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a 31% growth in people living on the streets of SÃ£o Paulo. This number, unfortunately, is often incorrect and much higher than that recorded by the government. With that in mind, the NGO chosen to receive this donation from the Yellow Hearts collection was Grupo do Panetone, an NGO located in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, which takes basic food baskets, hygiene kits and water to needy communities and homeless people.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-normal text-base leading-6 text-black pb-4">
                        I, Vitagliano, know the work of the Grupo do Panetone and I know that this donation will be of great help to those who need it most. By acquiring and holding a Yellow Heart, you become a Heart Keeper and have greater power over future community decisions. You can also receive NFT of the new collections for free and various airdrops (ours and partners).
                    </p>

                        Other project information can be seen in our roadmap (these can be changed as decisions are made together with the community), we are 100% open to community suggestions, always thinking about the improvement for it and all the steps taken by us (Vitagliano and Kinash) are and will be reported through social media and Discord annoucements.
